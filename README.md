## Home Assistant Barcode Scanner
ESPHome based barcode scanner for Home Assistant. No soldering or 3D printing required! Just put together, adopt in ESPHome builder using the provided .yaml file. Do not forget to also upload the custom component to esphome folder in your config/.

> **This fork** adds M5Stack **AtomS3 / AtomS3 Lite** (ESP32-S3) support alongside the original classic Atom Lite (ESP32), fixes a few bugs in the upstream `uart_readline` component, and adds on/off + manual-trigger button behavior with RGB status colors. See [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md) for details.

### Quick start

1. Copy `secrets.yaml.example` to `secrets.yaml` and fill in your Wi-Fi credentials.
2. Copy `esphome/custom_components/` into your ESPHome config folder (alongside the `.yaml` file), and copy `esphome_barcode_scanner.yaml` there too — or import it via the ESPHome Dashboard.
3. **If you have the classic Atom Lite (ESP32):** use `esphome_barcode_scanner.yaml` as-is.
   **If you have an AtomS3 / AtomS3 Lite (ESP32-S3):** use `esphome_barcode_scanner_atoms3.yaml` instead — pin numbers, board type, and the LED driver differ between the two chips.
4. Flash via `esphome run <file>.yaml` (first flash needs USB; later updates are OTA).

The main controller uses the ESP32-PICO-D4 solution, integrates a Wi-Fi module, has a built-in 3D antenna, and features 4 MB of SPI flash, providing Infra-Red, RGB Led, button, and GROVE/HY2.0 interfaces. The onboard USB Type-C interface allows for quick program upload and download, and there is an M2 screw hole on the back for fixing.     |

It supports three types of 2D codes and eight types of 1D codes that are mainstream in the market. The base is equipped with a buzzer and a fill light LED, providing sound prompts in different states and assisting with focus and aiming through a red LED. The module uses TTL for communication, allowing easy data transmission via a serial port. You can use the ESP32 built into the M5Atom host to transmit scanned data to the receiving end for processing, either wired or wirelessly. The back of the base is equipped with magnets, M3 screw holes, and LEGO-compatible holes, offering multiple installation options. It is suitable for logistics, retail, manufacturing, and other fields.   |
